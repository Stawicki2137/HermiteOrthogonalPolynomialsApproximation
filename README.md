# Least Squares Approximation in Hermite Polynomial Basis

This project implements **continuous least squares approximation** in the space L²ₙ(-∞, ∞)  
with weight function w(x) = e^(-x²) using the **Hermite polynomial basis**.

## Additional remarks
This project was created as part of coursework for Numerical Methods 2 classes.
